## Pourpose of this porject

We need an App to empower citizens and social workers to easily report pot holes in and around their locality. These citizens can also report the garbage littered around the city.
Also, these citizens keeping track of those problems status by clicking and uploading photographs periodically in the system. Once problem get resolved the citizens click photographs and submit to the system so system will do a comparison and provide notification accordingly. Also, we can notify the user, of the potholes and garbage in the area he is currently in. Also, if multiple complaints are received in regard to a particular locality, the government body is pressurized to solve that problem on urgent basis.
